# E-Doctor
This is a capstone project I made in college.
It is fully responsive and has very similar design with the Bootstrap theme I chose for the prototype. 
For the development of my project I used Twitter Bootstrap 4, HTML, and CSS.
I tested the responsive design of the project using Google Developer tools.

Online doctor consultations become more popular these days. Virtual care may effectively used to treat common problems such as cold, urinary tract infections, flu, headaches, etc. In this application virtual visits take place between patients and doctors via video and audio connectivity. It means that patient can interact with specialist from home or any other place convenient to him. 

I created the first page of E-Doctor website. 

I created two more pages of my website – Main page and My Account page, where you will see the Log In form. You can access them by selecting the menu buttons on the header. “Learn more” button is also clickable and it takes you to the “Our Services” page.
I changed the image on the main page as it shows a sick kid and a happy mom holds a device which reflects the main concept of my project – getting doctor’s help online. 

I implemented the hamburger menu button which appears at navigation bar once the screen becomes small. 
I am planning to create two additional pages to add to my project. 

I added two more pages to my project – See a Doctor and Contact Us page. The button “Start a Visit” on a “See a Doctor” page takes you to “My Account” page. 
I added jumbotron unit to all pages to make the background pop.
